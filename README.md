## Code and Analysis Samples

- 🏢 **[Apartments Plus](https://github.com/uchicago-capp-30320/apt-plus)** (May 2025 | Python, Django, PostGIS, JavaScript): the [webpage](https://aptpl.us) of Apartments Plus aggregates data for the city of Chicago (especially Hyde Park) that mainstream rental sites often do not display, such as LLM-generated summaries of building infractions, nearby grocery stores, and public transport stops and routes. This is a team project developed by eight contributors. My contributions included backend coding, product design, testing, and code review.

- 🏠 **[Heterogeneity of metropolitan areas in the United States](https://github.com/miguelperez94/heterogeneity_metro_areas_us/tree/main)** (December 2024 | Python, HTML, D3.js, CSS): Interactive analysis of the economic heterogeneity in the United States at the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) level, focusing on which places are improving (or not) economically in the United States based in its income, price indices, and population growth. Webpage currently available at this [link](https://heterogeneitymsaunitedstates.netlify.app/).

- 💸 **[Reduction of the debt-to-income ratio in the United States between 2007 and 2015](https://github.com/miguelperez94/reduction_dti_ratio_united_states)** (November 2024 | Python, Altair): Analysis at the state and county level of the generalized reduction in the household debt-to-income ratio that happened in the United States after the Great Recession. The findings highlight significant disparities in base levels of debt-to-income ratios and their change across states and counties, but preliminarily indicate almost no impact of this change in income and employment outcomes.

- 🏫 **[Distance and simulations to early education centers at Illinois](https://github.com/LosCAPPos/EarlyEducationProject)** (March 2024 | Python): Group project with three classmates to analyze (i) the distance at a census tract level to the closest early education center, and (ii) an optimization model to see in which census tracts new centers could have the greatest impact by reducing distances and travel time. My contributions included the backend for the optimization model and project management.
